    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rice is the backbone of many regional cuisines. Having the skill to quickly and reliably make a tasty pot of rice is essential for the proficient cook. This recipe will show you how to make rice that is fluffy, delicious, and consistent.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Uncooked Rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice 3-4 times in room temperature water to remove excess starch. This will keep the rice from having a gooey texture after cooking.</li>
        <li>Put the rice in a cooking pot with double the volume of water.</li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of butter and ground pepper to the water.</li>
        <li>Set the pot to high heat. As the butter dissolves, mix the water solution and the rice to evenly distribute the butter and pepper.</li>
        <li>As soon as the water begins boiling, place a lid on the pot and reduce the heat to low/simmer. Cook for 20 min.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
