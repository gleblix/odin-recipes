    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are a basic breakfast staple, and yet many people struggle to pull off this core dish. Prove your basic culinary chops and impress friends and family!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt an ample amount of butter into a preferably nonstick pan, at least 1tbsp for a small pan and more as needed. Heat the pan to medium-medium low heat.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk with a fork until they reach a uniform consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the heated pan. Cook the eggs 'low and slow', stirring consistently to avoid forming a cooked layer of eggs on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>As you keep stirring, continue to mix the uncooked eggs into the cooked parts, keeping the mixture moist and soft.
        </li>
        <li>Take off heat and serve before the eggs dry out.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
